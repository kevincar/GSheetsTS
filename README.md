# GSheetsTS

Google Apps Scripts provides two methods for working with and manipulating
data from google spreadsheets:

- SpreadsheetApp
- SheetsAPI

This project merges functionality from both of these interfaces. It also adds
the option to work with data in a spreadsheet as an array of objects rather
than as a two-dimensional array.
